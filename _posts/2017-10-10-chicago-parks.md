Stretching over 18 miles from Edgewater to South Shore, Chicago’s lakefront trail is perhaps the city’s most iconic park.

But the term "trail" is absurd. For most of its length, the paved path runs adjacent to a four lane highway! What’s the farthest it gets from a road? 608 feet (.11 miles), when it goes east around Museum Campus:

You won’t find solitude on the lakefront trail. What about Chicago’s largest park? At 1,208 acres, there’s a lot to see in Lincoln Park. But roads criss-cross through most of it, putting it at number seven on my list of Chicago’s most remote parks, as defined by the farthest one can get from a road:

## 7. Lincoln Park: 1,595 ft
The farthest point from a road in Lincoln Park is the Montrose Point Bird Sancturary.

> During the Cold War, Montrose point, which juts out into Lake Michigan, was used by the United States Army as a Nike missile base. The Army camouflaged their missile launchers and barracks behind honeysuckle hedges. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Park))

## 6. Powderhorn Marsh and Prairie: 1,614 ft

## 5. Beaubian Woods: 1,633 ft
> Before European settlement, Beaubien Woods was a wet prairie and open savanna community. Early agriculture and grazing altered the soil and removed native vegetation. Railroad and expressway construction further damaged soils and cleared areas for use in construction staging.

## 4. Catherine Chevalier Woods: 1,650 ft
Chevalier Woods is the most accessible park on this list: the entrance is less than a mile from the Cumberland stop on the Blue Line; the Des Plaines River Trail makes it easy to get to by bike; and if you're visiting from out of town, it's just a few miles from O'Hare airport! That last fact makes this park better for watching planes than birds. And as you can see from the photo there's almost no understory. You can thank the deer for that.

## 3. William W. Powers State Recreation Area: 1,814 ft
Powers Recreation Area is another former Nike missile site. There's not much to see here (apparently the main attraction is fishing) but you can get pretty far from a road by bushwacking out on this man-made peninsula.

## 2. Big Marsh (2,324 ft)
> Once the site of a waste and slag dumping ground from surrounding industrial operations since the late 1800s, the City of Chicago and the Chicago Park District teamed up in early 2000s to restore this area to a healthy habitat and eco-recreation park.  The Chicago Park District acquired the site in 2011... ([Chicago Park District](http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/parks/big-marsh-park-no564/))

## 1. Park No. 566 (2,614 ft)
The farthest point from a road in Chicago lies on the former site of U.S. Steel South Works. The steel mill was active from 1901 until its closure for economic reasons in 1992. The buildings were demolished in 1997. A narrow stretch of coast was acquired by the Park District for Park No. 566; the rest of the site is owned by Lakeside Development, LLC and has plans to be TODO. Should those plans materialize, expect the construction of new roads to bump this park off the list.

TODO: something about south side. industrial and military. I'll conclude with a bonus:

## Calumet Breakwater (6,066 ft)
It's not a park, but I can't resist including this concrete barrier that protects Calumet Harbor, stretching more than TODO miles into Lake Michigan. The lighthouse at the end is technically in Indiana waters!
