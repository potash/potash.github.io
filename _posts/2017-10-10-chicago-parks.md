Stretching over 18 miles from Edgewater to South Shore, Chicago’s lakefront trail is perhaps the city’s most iconic park.

But calling it a trail is a bit absurd as it runs almost adjacent to the four-lane monstrosity that is Lake Shore Drive. What’s the farthest this “trail” gets from a road? 608 feet (.11 miles), when it goes east around Museum Campus:
