# Introduction to Program Evaluation

Spring 2019<br/>
PBPL 26433<br/>
TuTh 12:30-1:50pm in Keller 0021<br/>
Office Hours TBD

## Summary

This course will teach students how to answer public policy questions using regression analysis. We will discuss applications from the fields of education, health, job training, and others. Students will learn the statistical foundations of regression as well as its practical implementation using the R programming language. They will study the interpretation of regression results including causal inference through experimental as well as quasi-experimental designs. No previous programming experience is assumed. This course satisfies the Public Policy practicum METHODS requirement. 

## Books and Resources

*Regression and Other Stories* (RAOS) by Andrew Gelman, Jennifer Hill, and Aki Vehtari. This book is not yet published. I will distribute photocopies in class. These have been generously shared with us by the authors. You may not re-distribute them.

## Grading

### Assignments (50%)
Most weeks, I will share an assignment at the end of class on Thursday covering that week's material. The assignment will be due the following Thursday before class (12:30pm) via Canvas. There will be 7 assignments total (no assignment due in weeks 1, 5, or 10). Your lowest assignment score will be dropped.

### Exams (50%)
There will be two take-home exams. A midterm in week 5 will be worth 20% of your grade and a final after week 10 worth 30%.

### Plagiarism Policy
Writing code is substantially different from writing essays: it is standard practice to find individual functions or google things that don’t work, and copy a line or two from a manual or Stack Overflow. I encourage you to discuss general strategies for solving problems with your classmates and friends. Questions and answers on the discussion board will naturally include code. However – you should never ask to see another’s solutions, and you absolutely should not copy code from your classmates. No one but you should type your code.

## Software
In this course we will be using a programming language called R analyze and visualize data. You will need to install three pieces of software. First install the R programming language itself. Next install RStudio. This is what's called an *integrated development environment*. It makes using R programming easier and more productive. Finally, install an R package called *tidyverse*. You'll find instructions for all of this in sections [1.4.1-1.4.3](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html#r) of the textbook R for Data Science.
