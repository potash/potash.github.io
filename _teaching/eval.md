# Introduction to Program Evaluation

Spring 2019<br/>
PBPL 26433<br/>
TuTh 12:30-1:50pm in Keller 0021<br/>
Office Hours TBD

## Summary

This course will teach students how to answer public policy questions using regression analysis. We will discuss applications from the fields of education, health, job training, and others. Students will learn the statistical foundations of regression as well as its practical implementation using the R programming language. They will study the interpretation of regression results including causal inference through experimental as well as quasi-experimental designs. No previous programming experience is assumed. This course satisfies the Public Policy practicum METHODS requirement. 

## Books and Resources

We will loosely follow two textbooks:

*Regression and Other Stories* (RAOS) by Andrew Gelman, Jennifer Hill, and Aki Vehtari. This book is not yet published. I will distribute photocopies of the relevant excerpts in class. These have been generously shared by the authors of this book for our class. You may not re-distribute them.

*R for Data Science* (r4ds) by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund. This book is available for free [online](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/). You may purchase a print copy if you prefer.

## Grading

### Assignments (60%)
Weekly assignments covering the previous weeks' material will be due on Thursdays before class (12:30pm) via Canvas. There will be 7 assignments total (no assignment due in Weeks 1, 5). Your lowest assignment score will be dropped.

### Exams (40%)
There will be two take-home exams. A midterm in week 5 will be worth 15% of your grade and a final after week 10 worth 25%.

### Plagiarism Policy
Writing code is substantially different from writing essays: it is standard practice to find individual functions or google things that don’t work, and copy a line or two from a manual or Stack Overflow. I encourage you to discuss general strategies for solving problems with your classmates and friends. Questions and answers on the discussion board will naturally include code. However – you should never ask to see another’s solutions, and you absolutely should not copy code from your classmates. No one but you should type your code.

## Software
In this course we will be using a programming language called R analyze and visualize data. You will need to install three pieces of software. First install the R programming language itself. Next install RStudio. This is what's called an *integrated development environment*. It makes using R programming easier and more productive. Finally, install an R package called *tidyverse*. You'll find instructions for all of this in sections [1.4.1-1.4.3](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html#r) of r4ds.
